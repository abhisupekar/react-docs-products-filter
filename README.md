# Product Search and Filter

![](product-filter.gif)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this Project, I've kept the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.

This project build using **React, React State, Bootstrap** effectively which shows proper representation of the used features.
